# Embedded_Systems_Fall2019
Collection of projects from my Embedded Systems class from the University of Cincinnati Fall 2019. This is for educational purposes only.

# Project Descriptions
All projects in this class were written in Verilog using Xilinx Vivado 2019.1 and the Basys 3 FPGA board
* Lab 2 - Elevator
  * Main purpose was to experiment with Moore state machines in Verilog
* Lab 3 - Vending Machine
  * Main purpose was to experiment with Mealy state machines in Verilog
* Lab 4 - VGA
  * Experimenting with the display features of the Basys 3 FPGA like VGA
* Basys-3-XADC
  * Analog to Digital converter using the Pmod ports on the FPGA
* Final Project
  * Created the memory pattern matching game "Simon"
    * Involved a random pattern generator
    * Potentiometer circuit with ADC to control difficulty
    * LED sequences for feedback and pattern display
